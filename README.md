# Hangman in C

This is a hangman game implemented using c. It works by reading a random word from a text file, and storing the string. The user must then guess the alphabets in the word, and if they make three wrong guesses they lose.

## What is left to be added
 - Formatting the guesses
 - Accounting for duplicate entries
 - ASSCI art for the hangman
